Dear Reviewers,

We have attached the three main functions for the submitted paper. Two of the functions implement the two variations of the multivariate Algorithm 1 with a dependence and conditional dependence measure. The third implements the univariate Algorithm 2 with a dependence measure.

Warm regards,
Eric and Shyam
